Final project for the Building AI course

## This project is about creating an app that uses AI to recommend better, less well known music to people to enchance their listening pleasure while supporting smaller artists.



## Summary

Finding good music can be hard and take too much time in our increasingly busy lives which is something I've found recently for myself too. Getting recommended fresh music based on stuff you already like is like a dream come true, especially if you get recommendations from smaller artists too!




## This app will eliminate all the time you've previously spent on searching for music and with that eliminate all your fustrations related to that!





# Data to the app comes from user's preferred listening service

## There is always the risk of not being able to recommend songs that will stay in the user's playlists or that the user doesn't like the songs recommended as people's tastes are very unique and can be unreliable.



# I'll need a team of talented coders and AI experts and some good marketing to make this work!




## I was inspired by my own struggles to find new, exciting music!
